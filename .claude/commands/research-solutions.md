# Research Solutions

You are tasked with analyzing solution options for new features or changes by spawning parallel sub-agents and synthesizing their findings into actionable recommendations optimized for create-plan consumption.

## Initial Setup:

When this command is invoked, respond with:
```
I'm ready to research solution options. Please provide:
- What feature/change you want to explore
- Any requirements or constraints you know about
- Reference to relevant ticket or research documents if available

I'll analyze the current codebase, generate solution options, and provide recommendations.
```

Then wait for the user's request.

## Steps to follow after receiving the request:

1. **Read context files and understand the problem:**
   - If user mentions tickets, research docs, or other files, read them FULLY first
   - **IMPORTANT**: Use Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters
   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files in main context before spawning sub-tasks
   - Extract requirements, constraints, and goals
   - Identify what problem we're solving

2. **Research current state and analyze requirements:**
   - **ALWAYS spawn fresh research** - Never rely on old research-codebase docs as truth
   - Old research can be read as historical context but validate against current code
   - Think deeply about requirements, constraints, and integration points
   - Create a todo list using TodoWrite to track research tasks

   **Spawn parallel research sub-tasks:**
   - Use **codebase-locator** to find relevant components
   - Use **codebase-analyzer** to understand current implementation
   - Use **codebase-pattern-finder** to find similar patterns
   - Use **thoughts-locator** to find historical context
   - Optional: **web-search-researcher** only if user requests

3. **Generate and compare solution options:**
   - Wait for ALL sub-agents to complete
   - Generate 2-4 viable approaches when possible
   - If only 1 clear option exists, explain why alternatives aren't viable
   - For each option, document:
     - How it works and precedent in codebase
     - Pros/cons with evidence
     - Complexity and integration points
     - Risk factors
   - Cross-reference agent findings
   - Compare options systematically

4. **Make recommendation:**
   - Choose best option based on requirements, codebase fit, and complexity
   - Provide clear rationale with evidence
   - Explain why alternatives were not chosen
   - Identify conditions that would change recommendation

5. **Determine metadata and filename:**
   - Filename format: `.claude/thoughts/shared/solutions/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_[topic].md`
     - YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS: Current date and time (e.g., 2025-10-11_14-30-22)
     - [topic]: Brief kebab-case description
   - Repository name: from git root basename
   - Use current git branch and commit from gitStatus in <env>
   - Researcher: Use "Claude Code"
   - If metadata unavailable: use "unknown" for commit/branch

6. **Generate solutions document:**
   - Use the metadata gathered in step 5
   - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:
     ```markdown
     ---
     date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]
     researcher: [Researcher name]
     git_commit: [Current commit hash]
     branch: [Current branch name]
     repository: [Repository name]
     topic: "[Feature/Problem]"
     confidence: high | medium | low
     complexity: low | medium | high
     status: ready | awaiting_input | blocked
     tags: [solutions, component-names]
     last_updated: [Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]
     last_updated_by: [Researcher name]
     ---

7. **Present findings:**
   - Present concise summary with clear recommendation
   - Highlight key integration points
   - Ask if they want to proceed to create-plan or need clarification

8. **Handle follow-up questions:**
   - If user has questions, append to same document
   - Update frontmatter: `last_updated` and `last_updated_by`
   - Add section: `## Follow-up Analysis [timestamp]`
   - Spawn additional sub-agents as needed

## Important notes:
- Always use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency and minimize context usage
- Always spawn fresh research to validate current state - never rely on old research-codebase docs as source of truth
- Old research documents can provide historical context but must be validated against current code
- Focus on generating 2-4 viable solution options with specific file:line references
- Solutions documents should be self-contained with all necessary context
- Each sub-agent prompt should be specific and focused on targeted research questions
- Quantify pattern precedent - count usage in codebase, don't just say "follows pattern"
- Ground complexity estimates in actual similar work from git history
- Think like a planner - you're setting up create-plan for success
- Keep the main agent focused on synthesis and comparison, not deep implementation details
- Encourage sub-agents to find existing patterns and examples, not just describe possibilities
- Resolve technical unknowns during research - don't leave critical questions for create-plan
- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning sub-tasks
- **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly
  - ALWAYS read mentioned files first before spawning sub-tasks (step 1)
  - ALWAYS spawn fresh research to validate current state (step 2)
  - ALWAYS wait for all sub-agents to complete before synthesizing (step 3)
  - ALWAYS gather metadata before writing the document (step 5 before step 6)
  - NEVER write the solutions document with placeholder values
