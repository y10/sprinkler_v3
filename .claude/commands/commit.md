# Commit Changes

You are tasked with creating git commits for repository changes.

## Context:
- **In-session**: If there's conversation history, use it to understand what was built/changed
- **Standalone**: If no context available, rely entirely on git state and file inspection

## Process:

1. **Think about what changed:**
   - **If in-session**: Review the conversation history to understand what was accomplished
   - **Always**: Run `git status` to see current changes
   - **Always**: Run `git diff` to understand the modifications in detail
   - If needed, inspect file contents to understand purpose and scope
   - Consider whether changes should be one commit or multiple logical commits

2. **Plan your commit(s):**
   - Identify which files belong together
   - Draft clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Use imperative mood in commit messages
   - Focus on why the changes were made, not just what
   - Check for sensitive information (API keys, credentials) before committing

3. **Present your plan to the user:**
   - List the files you plan to add for each commit
   - Show the commit message(s) you'll use
   - Ask: "I plan to create [N] commit(s) with these changes. Shall I proceed?"

4. **Execute upon confirmation:**
   - Use `git add` with specific files (never use `-A` or `.`)
   - Create commits with your planned messages
   - Show the result with `git log --oneline -n X` (where X = number of commits you just created)

## Important:

- **NEVER add co-author information or Claude attribution**
- Commits should be authored solely by the user
- Do not include any "Generated with Claude" messages
- Do not add "Co-Authored-By" lines
- Write commit messages as if the user wrote them

## Remember:

- Adapt your approach: use conversation context if available, otherwise infer from git state
- In-session: you have full context of what was done; Standalone: infer from git analysis
- Group related changes by purpose (feature, fix, refactor, docs)
- Keep commits atomic: one logical change per commit
- Split into multiple commits if: different features, mixing bugs with features, or unrelated concerns
- The user trusts your judgment - they asked you to commit
